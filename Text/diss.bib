The proposed model is a semipara- metric generalization of a parametric model due to Farewell (1982). Estimates of the regression parameters are obtained by maximizing a Monte Carlo approximation of a marginal likelihood and the EM algorithm is used to estimate the baseline survivor function. We present some simulation results to verify the validity of the suggested estimation procedure. It appears that the semiparametric estimates are reasonably efficient with acceptable bias whereas the parametric estimates can be highly dependent on the parametric assumptions.},

We consider Bayesian methods for right-censored survival data for populations with a surviving (cure) fraction. We propose a model that is quite different from the standard mixture model for cure rates. We provide a natural motivation and interpretation of the model and derive several novel properties of it. First, we show that the model has a proportional hazards structure, with the covariates depending naturally on the cure rate. Second, we derive several properties of the hazard function for the proposed model and establish mathematical relationships with the mixture model for cure rates. Prior elicitation is discussed in detail, and classes of noninformative and informative prior distributions are proposed. Several theoretical properties of the proposed priors and resulting posteriors are derived, and comparisons are made to the standard mixture model. A real dataset from a melanoma clinical trial is discussed in detail.},

abstract = {The evaluation of cancer treatment efficiency is often based on the risk of local recurrence. When applied to the statistical analysis of tumor recurrence data, a pertinent parametric method has the following distinct advantages: (1) it allows a natural interpretation in terms of parameters bearing clear biological meaning, (2) it provides a prediction of the recurrence risk forward in time beyond the follow-up period, (3) it offers a means of estimating survival fraction (probability of tumor cure) from the time-to-recurrence observations. This paper discusses a stochastic model of tumor recurrence based on the consideration of biological processes of tumor latency within the random minima framework. A parametric family of distributions is obtained that allows for a survival fraction, thereby providing an estimate of the probability of tumor cure. When applying the model to data on breast cancer, we estimate the expected number of clonogens which give rise to early and late recurrences and their progression rate parameters. The prime object of our concern is discrimination between true recurrence and spontaneuos carcinogenesis on the basis of the temporal characteristics of the tumor latency. As evidenced by the data analysis, such a discrimination is feasible and allows to conclude that the contralateral breast cancer may be interpreted as a preexisting subclinical tumor at the time of treatment.},

This article considers the utility of the bounded cumulative hazard model in cure rate estimation, which is an appealing alternative to the widely used two-component mixture model. This approach has the following distinct advantages: (1) It allows for a natural way to extend the proportional hazards regression model, leading to a wide class of extended hazard regression models. (2) In some settings the model can be interpreted in terms of biologically meaningful parameters. (3) The model structure is particularly suitable for semiparametric and Bayesian methods of statistical inference. Notwithstanding the fact that the model has been around for less than a decade, a large body of theoretical results and applications has been reported to date. This review article is intended to give a big picture of these modeling techniques and associated statistical problems. These issues are discussed in the context of survival data in cancer.},

abstract = {Applied statisticians in many fields frequently analyze time-to-event data. While the statistical tools presented in this book are applicable to data from medicine, biology, public health, epidemiology, engineering, economics and demography, the focus here is on applications of the techniques to biology and medicine. The analysis of survival experiments is complicated by issues of censoring and truncation. The use of counting process methodology has allowed for substantial advances in the statistical theory to account for censoring and truncation in survival experiments. This book makes these complex techniques accessible to applied researchers without the advanced mathematical background. The authors present the essentials of these techniques, as well as classical techniques not based on counting processes, and apply them to data. The second edition contains some new material as well as solutions to the odd-numbered revised exercises. New material consists of a discussion of summary statistics for competing risks probabilities in Chapter 2 and the estimation process for these probabilities in Chapter 4. A new section on tests of the equality of survival curves at a fixed point in time is added in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8 an expanded discussion is presented on how to code covariates and a new section on discretizing a continuous covariate is added. A new section on Lin and Ying's additive hazards regression model is presented in Chapter 10. We now proceed to a general discussion of the usefulness of this book incorporating the new material with that of the first edition.},

abstract = {We propose a Bayesian semiparametric model for survival data with a cure fraction. We explicitly consider a finite cure time in the model, which allows us to separate the cured and the uncured populations. We take a mixture prior of a Markov gamma process and a point mass at zero to model the baseline hazard rate function of the entire population. We focus on estimating the cure threshold after which subjects are considered cured. We can incorporate covariates through a structure similar to the proportional hazards model and allow the cure threshold also to depend on the covariates. For illustration, we undertake simulation studies and a full Bayesian analysis of a bone marrow transplant data set. {\textcopyright} Board of the Foundation of the Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 2008.},

@article{Nieto-Barajas2002a,
abstract = {This paper generalizes the discrete time independent increment beta process of Hjort (1990), for modelling discrete failure times, and also generalizes the independent gamma process for modelling piecewise constant hazard rates (Walker and Mallick, 1997). The generalizations are from independent increment to Markov increment prior processes allowing the modelling of smoothness. We derive posterior distributions and undertake a full Bayesian analysis.},
